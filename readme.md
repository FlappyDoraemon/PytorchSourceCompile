# Utilities.KH

Some utility-scripts I am using to set up my environments or to install packages.

- Solving the gcc-version issue when installing pytorch by source-compiling. The solution is to remove previous higher-version gcc and install an lower-version gcc (downgrade).

- Setting up github ssh connections.
