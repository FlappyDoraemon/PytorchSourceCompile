Some utility-scripts I am using to set up my environments or to install packages.


(1) Solving the gcc-version issue when installing pytorch by source-compiling.

The solution is to remove previous higher-version gcc and install an lower-version gcc (downgrade).

(2) Setting up github ssh connections.
